A Note to the reader regarding the "Learning Outcome Findings" section: 
```
   [1]  Clearly stated business understanding of problem
   [2]  Clean and organized notebook with data cleaning
   [3]  Correct and concise interpretation of descriptive and inferential 
        statistics
   [4]  Clearly stated findings in their own section with actionable items 
        highlighted in appropriate language for a non-technical audience
   [5]  Next steps and recommendations
```

In the pdf file is the write up, giving both the Business and AI/Analytic 
perspective.  The only thing about the paper is that it is not concise, and 
the more I learned about Precision Recall, Confusion Matrix & ROC, the further
I needed to go in order to better understand the methods and how they apply
in a business context.

As I was stating the business problem and relating it to the AIML classification
models,  I got pretty deep into it. And the deeper I went, the deeper I had to go. 
That said, by reading through the introduction and conclusion as well as the 
exhibits, one can scan through for a concise overview of the topics mentioned.
With the exception of a few of the AIML details, it is my hope that this was 
understandable and coherent for a general business audience.
